# CO<sub>2</sub> Calculator 

Python package to calculate CO2 emissions of business trips, heating and electricity consumption.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description

This package is part of Pledge4Future, a project to quantify, monitor and reduce work-related emissions collectively and sustainably. [more info, Link to Website]

## ‚å® How to Use

[...]

The CO<sub>2</sub> Calculator uses the [OpenRouteService (ORS) API](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs) to obtain distances between the locations provided by the user to calculate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of business trips. This requires an API key, which is read from an `.env` file.

### Create an ORS API key and save it in your .env file

1) Go to https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/signup and create an account (or sign up with GitHub).
2) In the Dev dashboard, switch to the tab `TOKENS` and request a free token.
3) Once you have the key, click on it to copy it to clipboard.
4) Insert the key into [sample.env](sample.env) and rename the file to `.env`.
