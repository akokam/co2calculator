Welcome!

With 1.3 t of CO2 generated per person each year in Germany, heating is among the largest CO2 emittents. Since most of the buildings in Germany are still heated with the fossil fuels oil and gas, there is a high potential to reduce emissions generated by heating! Let's see how the situation is at your institute.

**_What we ask you to do:_**

We ask your institute to answer the following questions about your heating consumption and energy source during the year 2019. This only needs to be done once for the entire institute.
