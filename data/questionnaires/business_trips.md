Welcome!

Transport is responsible for about one quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. The greenhouse gas emissions of the transport sector in Europe are only declining slowly and still remain higher than in 1990.

As part of the assessment of your institutions' total carbon footprint we would like to quantify the emissions from business and field trips.

**_What we ask you to do:_**

We ask you to answer the following questions about the business trips and field trips you took in the previous year. Check your travel expense forms to fill in the information for each trip individually.

We would like to emphasize that we ask for this **anonymous data** to get an aggregated database for your **entire institution** to suggest further mitigation actions! Please give honest replies.

_Thank you for your participation!_
