# Field trips Teaching

Draft for webpage

Welcome!

\<Some hard facts about mobility and its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions firing the crisis.>

As part of the assessment of your institutions' total carbon footprint of 2019, we want to quantify the emissions from field trips related to teaching.

**_What we ask you to do:_**

We ask you to answer the following questions about the field trips you organized for teaching in 2019.

We would like to emphasize that we ask for this **anonymous data** to get an aggregated database (we all like data, don't we?) for your **entire institution** to suggest further mitigation actions! We are aware of the value these kinds of trips and the difficulty of organizing them in a sustainable way.

Please give honest replies.

_Thank you for your participation!_

\_\_

1\. Were you teaching at \<insert institute name>** in 2019** and organizing one or multiple field trips for teaching?

* [ ] Yes
* [ ] No

`(If "Yes" then further questions will pop up. If "No", there is only a submit button and the message "Thank you, you're done!")`

2\. Which modes of transport did you use?

* [ ] Air travel
* [ ] Car travel
* [ ] Public transport

`(Multiple choice. If "Air travel" ticked -> show questions 3, if "Car travel" ticked -> show questions 4, if "Public transport" ticked -> show questions 5)`

3a. Please list the flight route for each air travel.

If possible, write down the airport codes (e.g. FRA for Frankfurt) but if you don't know it, then just put down the city names. **Please include all intermediate stops.**

Example: FRA-EZE-SCL-LSC-SCL-EZE-FRA or Frankfurt-Buenos Aires-Santiago-La Serena-Santiago-Buenos Aires-Frankfurt).

3d. If you remember, please list the **carrier airline** for each trip. Otherwise please choose "I don't know/other".

_(Carbon emissions differ between different airlines mainly due to different  airplane models used. If you used several different airlines for a single trip then either split up your trip or list the dominant one.)_

`Rows according to trips given in 3a. For each trip the tick options "Lufthansa", "Air France", "Iberia", "United", "Delta", "American Airlines", "Lan Chile", "Alitalia", "KLM", "British Airways", "I don't know/other"`

4a. Please list the distance (km) for each car travel. If you went to a place with multiple cars, please enter them as separate trips.

_(You can use _[_OpenStreetMap_](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)_ to obtain the distance from start to destination address. If you took the same route to get to your destination and back, please enter the total distance.)_
