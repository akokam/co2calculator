Welcome!

The CO2 emissions for electricity in Germany amount to 1 t per person and year, making it one of the largest CO2 emitters. Despite the rising share of renewable energy in the electricity mix, it is still a good idea to save power wherever you can. Let's check how your institute performs!

\_

_**What we ask you to do:**_

We ask your institute to answer the following questions about your electricity consumption during the previous year. This only needs to be done once for your institute.

_Thank you for your participation!_

1\. Please select the type of your electricity contract. If it is unknown, please select "Standard".

* [ ] Standard (German electricity mix)

2\. What is the annual electricity consumption at your institute? Please specify how much electricity your institute consumed during the previous year in kWh.

3\. Often electricity consumption data is only available on the building level. If your electricity consumption data is for the whole building, but your research group only uses part of the building, please give your best estimate of your research group's share of the total electricity consumption. This may depend on the type and amount of appliances that your research group uses. You may also simply use the share of the building area that your research group uses as an approximation. If this question does not apply to you, you can skip it.

Share of your research group's electricity consumption (value between 0 and 1): _____
