# Commuting

Draft for webpage

Welcome!

Transport is responsible for about one quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. The greenhouse gas emissions of the transport sector in Europe are only declining slowly and still remain higher than in 1990.

As part of the assessment of your institutions' total carbon footprint of the previous year, we want to quantify the emissions from commuting between your home and your workplace.

**_What we ask you to do:_**

We ask you to answer the following questions about how you are commuting to work.

We would like to emphasize that we ask for this **anonymous data** to get an aggregated database for your **entire institution** to suggest further mitigation actions! Please give honest replies.

_Thank you for your participation!_

1\. Please enter the number of weeks you were working in the previous year. Please account for all times you were not working such as paid leave, public holidays, or a contract not lasting the entire year. Example: 52 (weeks per year) - 4 (paid leave) - 2 (public holidays) = 46

3\. Please enter the distance you commuted per week in the previous year with the transportation mode `transportation mode selected in question 2`.

Please enter your usual commuting behaviour. If you often use a different mode of transport if there is bad weather or in the cold season, please account for this by estimating the mean distance for each transportation mode over the entire year.
