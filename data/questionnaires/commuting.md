Welcome!

\<Some hard facts about mobility and its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions firing the crisis.>

As part of the assessment of your institutions' total carbon footprint of 2019, we want to quantify the emissions from commuting between your home and your workplace.

**_What we ask you to do:_**

We ask you to answer the following questions about how you're commuting to work.

We would like to emphasize that we ask for this **anonymous data** to get an aggregated database (we all like data, don't we?) for your **entire institution** to suggest further mitigation actions! Please give honest replies.

_Thank you for your participation!_

\_\_

1\. Were you employed or a long-term guest at \<insert institution name> **for at least 6 months in 2019?**

* [ ] Yes
* [ ] No

`(If "Yes" then next question(s) will pop up. If "No", there is only a submit button and the message "Thank you, you're done!")`

2\. For how many months did you regularly commute to your institution?

\_\_\_\_\_

_(If you were not commuting to the institution for a longer timespan of 2019, e.g. because you were not employed, in parental leave, etc., we will omit this time span in our calculation. Otherwise, we will only omit 4 weeks of holidays.)_

\_\_

3\. How many km did you usually commute per week in 2019 by ...

* [ ] car: \_\_\_\_\_
* [ ] bike: \_\_\_\_\_
* [ ] e-bike: \_\_\_\_\_
* [ ] train: \_\_\_\_\_
* [ ] tram: \_\_\_\_\_
* [ ] bus: \_\_\_\_\_
* [ ] e-scooter: \_\_\_\_\_

_(If you use different modes of transport, enter them individually. E.g. 6 km per train and 4 km per bike each day with a 5-day working week: train: 30 km, bike: 20 km. Enter your usual commuting behaviour. If you often use a different mode of transport if there is bad weather or in the cold season, you might want to account for this i.e. use the other mode of transport for the weekly distance for one or multiple days when calculating the weekly distance.)_
